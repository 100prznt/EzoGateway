# EzoGateway Hardware

For a better usability of the EzoGateway a custom PCB was designed, which replaces the Whitebox T3 HAT and adds some features. Designed as an inverted HAT, the PCB carries up to 3 Atlas Scientific EZOâ„¢ circuits in addition to the Raspberry Pi.

## Features

| Count | Feature                   | Connector                           | Description                 |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|       | wide range power supply   | Wago MCS or coaxial power connector | 9 - 36 VDC (min. 5 W)       |
| 2     | isolated EZO sockets      | BNC                                 | for pH and O.R.P. circuit   |
| 1     | non-isolated EZO sockets  | BNC                                 | for RTD circuit             |
| 2/3   | external 1-wire channels  | Wago MCS                            | for digital temp. sensors   |
| 1     | on-board temp. sensor     |                                     | on seperate int. 1-wire ch. |
|       | expansion port (I2C, SPI) | .10" pin header                     |                             |
|       | fits for ALUBOS 1000      |                                     |                             |
