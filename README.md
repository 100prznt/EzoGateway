## Hardware
For fast hardware integration there is a cool project from [Whitebox](https://github.com/whitebox-labs). The [Tentacle T3 HAT](https://github.com/whitebox-labs/tentacle-raspi-oshw) accepts three Atlas Scientific EZO™ devices, two of them are electrically isolated.

## Releases
This project build on the continuous integration (CI) platform [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) and released in the [Release-Feed](https://github.com/100prznt/EzoGateway/releases).
